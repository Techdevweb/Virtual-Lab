# Virtual-Lab
All experiments of the Bio-Tech virtual lab.

##During Pandemic students were not able to attend labs and see experiments in person. So we our College took an initiative to develop virtual lab called
"VLab" for students so that can visually see experiemnts procedure from home. I was assigned to develop experiments for Bio-Technology Department using 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It really helped students as they were able to understand all the lab experiments easily without being in lab in person.
